# 😎 SIGMA
SIGMA (Sistema Intuitivo de Gestão de Matérias Acadêmicas) is an academic system designed to be more intuitive and easier than SIGAA (Sistema Integrado de Gestão de Atividades Acadêmicas)

### 🐳 Run with docker:
To run with Docker is simple, you can just compose the file docker-compose.yml and then you can access [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). If you want to configure something, just change the docker-compose.yml or the Dockerfile.

<mark>WARNING</mark>: when the app initializes for the first time, it will create a superadmin in the database, the default username and password is "admin" for both
So, you will need to change it after running for the first time.
